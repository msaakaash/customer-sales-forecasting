# Customer Sales Forecasting & Churn Prediction

A full-stack data science project that forecasts customer sales and predicts churn using machine learning, visual analytics, and interactive dashboards. This project is containerized with Docker and production-ready with a REST API built using FastAPI.


##  Features

- `Data Cleaning & Preprocessing`
- `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`
- `Feature Engineering & Customer Segmentation`
- `Predictive Modeling (Sales Forecasting & Churn Prediction)`
- `Model Evaluation & Selection`
- `Interactive Dashboard using Streamlit`
- `REST API using FastAPI for model serving`
- `Dockerized for easy deployment`


## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values, outliers, and feature encoding
- Scaled features for modeling

### Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualized sales trends, customer segments, and patterns
- Grouped insights by product, region, and customer

### Phase 3: Feature Engineering & Clustering
- Created new insightful features
- Applied KMeans clustering for segmentation
- Visualized clusters using heatmaps and elbow curves

### Phase 4: Predictive Modeling
- Built and compared multiple models (RandomForest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Selected best model based on performance metrics
- Saved model with `joblib`

### Phase 5: Streamlit Dashboard
- Built an interactive dashboard to visualize insights and make predictions
- Integrated trained model with Streamlit interface

### Phase 6: API & Dockerization
- Created a FastAPI backend for real-time prediction
- Dockerized the API for scalable deployment
